# Rise8 Continuous Delivery Approach

At **Rise8**, our mission revolves around achieving continuous delivery of impactful software that users love.

## Continuous Delivery: The Feedback Loop

Continuous delivery forms the feedback loop essential for achieving small batch sizes and iterating towards impactful software that brings joy to users. This process is carried out within a balanced team where the product manager practices lean enterprise, and UX focuses on user-centered design.

## Continuous Delivery First Approach

While numerous measures can be taken to mitigate risks, the ultimate validation point is the production environment. Hence, we adopt a continuous delivery first approach to establish learning feedback loops.

## Leveraging DORA Insights

We highly value the insights provided by the **DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)** in identifying the key factors for achieving continuous delivery. We not only adhere to the DORA top five but also incorporate other crucial capabilities they've identified as contributors. This includes automated testing, clean code, loose coupling, monitoring, trunk-based development, and deployment automation, among others.

## High Compliance Spaces: Ensuring Security and Best Practices

In high compliance spaces, we are pioneers in ensuring that deployment automation encompasses security compliance and adheres to release engineering best practices. This is particularly crucial due to the sensitivity and complexity of deployment environments.

## Balancing Capability and Security

Emphasizing both capability and security, we want to make it clear that continuous delivery doesn't necessitate accepting more risk; in fact, it actively reduces risk.

## Effective Communication for Stakeholder Buy-In

Our team possesses the expertise to communicate these principles effectively to both customers and stakeholders. This ensures the necessary buy-in to complete the feedback loops that unlock continuous delivery.
