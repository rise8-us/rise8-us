# ArgoCD Best Practices

[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. To ensure optimal use and management, consider the following best practices:

## 1. Declarative Configuration:
   - Use ArgoCD to manage Kubernetes manifests declaratively through Git repositories.
   - Store all application and environment configurations in version-controlled repositories.

## 2. Repository Structure:
   - Organize your Git repositories logically, separating applications and environments.
   - Follow a directory structure that reflects the hierarchy of your clusters and applications.

## 3. Sync and Health Status:
   - Regularly monitor the synchronization status of applications.
   - Leverage the ArgoCD UI or CLI to check the health status of your applications.

## 4. Automated Sync Policies:
   - Configure automated synchronization policies based on your deployment requirements.
   - Set up periodic syncs to ensure that the desired state is continuously maintained.

## 5. Promotion Workflow:
   - Implement a promotion workflow through different Git branches (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`).
   - Use ArgoCD AppProject to define access control policies for different environments.

## 6. Helm and Kustomize Support:
   - Utilize Helm charts or Kustomize for managing complex application configurations.
   - ArgoCD natively supports Helm charts and Kustomize overlays.

## 7. Secret Management:
   - Securely manage sensitive information like secrets and credentials outside of the Git repository.
   - Integrate with external secret management tools and Kubernetes Secret resources.

## 8. Rollback and Roll-forward:
   - Test and document rollback procedures for easy recovery in case of issues.
   - Embrace roll-forward by applying corrections or updates instead of reverting changes.

## 9. Monitoring and Alerts:
   - Set up monitoring for ArgoCD itself using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Define alerts to notify teams about synchronization failures or other critical issues.

## 10. RBAC and Security:
   - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to ArgoCD resources.
   - Regularly review and update RBAC policies based on team changes.

## 11. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):
   - Leverage ArgoCD's Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and manage applications.
   - Understand and use ArgoCD-specific features like AppProject for advanced application management.

## 12. Backup and Restore:
   - Periodically back up the ArgoCD server's data, including the configuration and application state.
   - Have a well-documented process for restoring ArgoCD from backups.

## 13. Documentation:
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation on ArgoCD usage, configurations, and best practices.
   - Provide guidance on common tasks, troubleshooting, and onboarding.

## 14. Community Engagement:
   - Stay informed about ArgoCD updates, releases, and community discussions.
   - Contribute to the ArgoCD community and share experiences and best practices.

By adhering to these ArgoCD best practices, teams can effectively manage Kubernetes applications, streamline deployment workflows, and ensure a robust GitOps-based continuous delivery process.
