# Writing a Simple API with Flask (Python)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating a simple RESTful API using Python and the Flask web framework. Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for building web applications, including APIs.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python ([Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/))
- Flask (`pip install Flask`)

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir flask-api-tutorial
cd flask-api-tutorial
```

## Step 2: Creating a Virtual Environment
It's good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. Create a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
```

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
This step ensures that your project has a dedicated environment for its dependencies, minimizing conflicts and ensuring consistency across different projects.
```

## Step 3: Installing Flask
Install Flask within the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

## Step 4: Writing the API Code
Create a file named app.py in your project directory and open it in a text editor. Add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    data = {'message': 'Hello, API!'}
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a basic Flask application with a single endpoint (/api) that returns a JSON response.

## Step 5: Running the API
In the terminal, run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/api in your browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to make a GET request.
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
You should receive a JSON response: {"message": "Hello, API!"}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a simple API using Flask. This is just a starting point, and you can expand and enhance your API by adding more routes, handling different HTTP methods, and integrating with databases.
